# Denial-of-Service Simulation & Defense Tuning

Tests resilience of systems and network devices under DoS and DDoS conditions.  
Traffic floods were generated, analyzed, and mitigated to evaluate resource handling and security controls.

**Key Tools:** hping3, HOIC, LOIC, Raven-Storm, Anti-DDoS Guardian  
**Skills Demonstrated:** Layer-3/4/7 DoS simulation, network monitoring, mitigation rule tuning, and bandwidth analysis.
