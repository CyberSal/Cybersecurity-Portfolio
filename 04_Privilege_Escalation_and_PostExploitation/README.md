# Privilege Escalation & Post-Exploitation Simulation

Simulates attacker behavior after initial access to evaluate defensive posture and privilege boundaries.  
The project walks through password cracking, privilege escalation, persistence creation, and log-clearing techniques in a controlled environment.

**Key Tools:** Metasploit, Responder, Mimikatz, PowerSploit, BeRoot  
**Skills Demonstrated:** Privilege escalation, persistence mechanisms, credential extraction, and evidence evasion.
